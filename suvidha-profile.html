      <p style="font-size: 0.2em;"> My name is Suvidha Khanna Chanana. I am from Shimla, India and I am in the Communication Design program. Before North Island College, I was working as a trainee at an ad agency and studied my Graduation Degree in Applied Arts. In my program, I enjoyed the whole process of learning, making friends and spending most of my time in Mac Lab (it became my first home). The faculty has been very supportive and soon, we all together - the students and profs - were like a gang. I very much have embraced and learned more and developed as a designer in this course of time. The biggest thing I have learned from the program is design skills, understanding of type, use of the Adobe Suite, printing techniques and a better understanding of camera and photography. After graduation I plan to work as a designer and impact society with my designs and ideas. My favourite courses were Typography, Graphic Design, Photography, Video & Sound and Printmaking. A lot of credit goes to the professors teaching these courses, as they made me fall in love with the them along with great learning. Typography meant nothing but the alphabet to me before this course and now it's one of the assets I have added to my little bag of knowledge. Designing was my passion, but now I feel more confident and polished. Photography, Video, Sound (foley) and Printmaking were new to me and now I can say I am getting better at them and would love to explore them more in depth. The project I am displaying in the showcase is Hot Chocolates. Hot Chocolates is an Island based artisan chocolate brand. They opened their first store in 1986. Their current branding does not invite people of all ages in. To make the brand appeal to a larger target audience, Hot Chocolates needed a brand makeover. Along with the refurbishing their logo, we would also create new and more innovative packaging for their truffles. These packages will not only make them stand apart from their competitors but also encourage more interactivity with the brand. My favourite tools/software/applications are HTML, CSS, WordPress, Sketch, Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Lightroom. I am a self-proclaimed final semester Interactive Media and Communication Design student at NIC. I am an ambitious designer who wants to impact the society with my design ideas. I have experienced various educational flavours before settling for design, which is my favourite and I can blissfully relish it for the rest of my life. I have had a keen interest for drawing and creation since forever. Graphic Design and Photography were my guilty pleasures during the time of graduation. This made me venture into numerous different fields, only to bring me back to my true self, which I found in design. The course introduced me to the exquisite art of typography and soon enough it became a part of my design philosophy. I had some exposure of the advertising world and there I saw the power design had at influencing and creating an impact on the society and people. This is my dream and the very part of my being now. I wish to design, to bring a difference. On display are some of the pieces I designed during my tenure at NIC. Typography and design both complete my displayed pieces.
