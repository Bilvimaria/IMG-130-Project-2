      <p > My name is Suvidha Khanna Chanana. I am from Shimla, India and I am 
        in the Communication Design program. Before North Island College, I was working as a trainee at an ad agency and studied my Graduation Degree in Applied Arts. 
        In my program, I enjoyed the whole process of learning, making friends and spending most of my time in Mac Lab (it became my first home). 
        The faculty has been very supportive and soon, we all together - the students and profs - were like a gang. 
        I very much have embraced and learned more and developed as a designer in this course of time. 
        The biggest thing I have learned from the program is design skills, understanding of type, use of the Adobe Suite, printing techniques and a better 
        understanding of camera and photography.
