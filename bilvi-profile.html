    <div class="bio">
      <p>My name is Bilvi Maria Joseph. I am from Kerala, India and I am in the Web and Mobile Application Development program. Before North Island College, I was working as an Executive Customer Engineer at Zafin Software Centre of Excellence and studied my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science. In my program, I enjoyed the transition of the 16 lines of code that I wrote in my first semester to a single line in the last semester, and printing the numbers from 1 to 100 on the screen to actual MVC architecture. The biggest thing I have learned from the program is that programmers never stop learning. After graduation I plan to work as a Mobile Application Developer. My favourite courses were Java, Database, Swift, iOS Application Development, Android Application Development, JavaScript and SCSS. The project I am displaying in the showcase is an iOS application that helps the user send their location to their chosen contacts in case of an emergency situation. My favourite tools/software/applications are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Sketch, Adobe Illustrator, Swift, XCode, iOS, Android, Android Studio, SCSS, Object Oriented Programming, MVC Architecture, Visual Studio Code, Atom, GitHub, GitLab, Bit Bucket, MySQL and Postgre SQL. I would say that I am a great team player, excellent problem solver with the ability to work independently or in a team. I am also detail oriented and I love to learn constantly.
