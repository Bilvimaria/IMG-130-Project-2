    <div class="bio">
      <p> My name is Jason Thompson. I am from Duncan and I am in the Communication Design program. Before North Island
        College,
        I was working internationally in the oilfield sector. In my program, I enjoyed creating awesome projects,
        getting honest
        and relevant critiques from students and instructors and learning to use industry standard software.
        The biggest thing I have learned from the program is to create something from nothing.
        After graduation I plan to start a career in web development and continue honing my skills.
        My favourite course was Social Media because I love learning how it all works, and what is successful and what
        isnâ€™t.
        I also enjoyed Computer Graphics 1 and 2 because of the cool but challenging projects that teach you relevant,
        hard skills for design. The project I am displaying in the showcase is The Greenways Loop Signage and website.
        I designed new wayfinding signs for the Greenways Loop, a cycling and pedestrian trail that surrounds the city
        of
        Campbell River. In addition to the signs I also created a website specifically for the trail that will showcase
        an
        interactive map of the trail that visitors can use to learn more about the trail.
        My favourite tools/software/applications are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator.
