    <div class="bio">
      <p> My name is Jason Thompson. I am from Duncan and I am in the Communication Design program. Before North Island College, 
          I was working internationally in the oilfield sector. In my program, I enjoyed creating awesome projects, getting honest 
          and relevant critiques from students and instructors and learning to use industry standard software. 
          The biggest thing I have learned from the program is to create something from nothing. 
          After graduation I plan to start a career in web development and continue honing my skills. 
          My favourite course was Social Media because I love learning how it all works, and what is successful and what isnâ€™t. 
          I also enjoyed Computer Graphics 1 and 2 because of the cool but challenging projects that teach you relevant, 
          hard skills for design. The project I am displaying in the showcase is The Greenways Loop Signage and website. 
          I designed new wayfinding signs for the Greenways Loop, a cycling and pedestrian trail that surrounds the city of 
          Campbell River. In addition to the signs I also created a website specifically for the trail that will showcase an 
          interactive map of the trail that visitors can use to learn more about the trail. 
          My favourite tools/software/applications are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator.
